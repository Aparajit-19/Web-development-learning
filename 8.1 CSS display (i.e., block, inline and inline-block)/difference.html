                            <!-- Difference between block, inline and inline-block -->
<!-- display: block;
 An element (i.e., paragraph element or other) that has the display property set to block starts on a new line and 
 takes up the available screen width as default but you can specify the width and height properties additionally 
 for such elements. Examples of elements that are at block-level by default are <div>, <p>, <li>, and lots more.
-->

<!-- display: inline;
An element (i.e., paragraph element or other) with a display property set to inline will not start on a new line 
and it will take up the remaining / available screen width. It just takes up the space such an element would 
normally take. We can't set the width and height of an element that has a display of inline. Some elements are 
inline by default, like <span>, <a> and <img>.
-->

<!-- display: inline-block;
An element (i.e., paragraph element or other) you assign a display of inline-block is inline by presentation. But 
it has the added advantage of you being able to apply width and height to it, which you can't do when the element 
is assigned a dispaly of inline. So, you can look at the inline-block display as an inline element and block element
in one package.
