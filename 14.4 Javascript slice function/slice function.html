                                            <!-- FUNCTION -->
<!--
    1. slice function: This function returns a new array containing a portion of the array on which it is 
       implemented. The original remains unchanged.

       1(a.) Syntax: arr.slice(begin, end);
             - begin: This parameter defines the starting index from where the portion is to be extracted. If this 
               argument is missing then the method takes begin as 0 as it is the default start value.
             - end: This parameter is the index up to which the portion is to be extracted (excluding the end index).
               If this argument is not defined then the array till the end is extracted as it is the default end 
               value. If the end value is greater than the length of the array, then the end value changes to the 
               length of the array.
             - Return value: This method returns a new array containing some portion of the original array. 

       1(b.) Example:
             - Code: // Original Array
                      let arr = [23, 56, 87, 32, 75, 13];
                      // Extracted array
                      let new_arr = arr.slice(2, 4);
             - Output: [23,56,87,32,75,13]
                       [87,32]
