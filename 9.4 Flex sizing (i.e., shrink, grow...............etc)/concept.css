   2. Difference between container elements and child elements:
      2(a). Container elements: The container element, also known as the flex container, is the parent element that
            contains a group of child elements. It is responsible for defining the main axis and cross axis of the 
            flex layout. In CSS, you can create a flex container by applying the display: flex; property to an 
            element. For example, consider the following HTML structure: 
                     <div class="flex-container">
                     <div class="child">Child 1</div>
                     <div class="child">Child 2</div>
                     <div class="child">Child 3</div>
                     </div>
                     In this case, the <div> element with the class "flex-container" acts as the flex container. 
                     
      2(b). Child Elements: Child elements, also known as flex items, are the individual elements contained within 
            the flex container. These elements are positioned and aligned along the main axis and cross axis of the
            flex layout according to the flex container's properties. The child elements are direct descendants of
            the flex container. In the example HTML structure mentioned earlier, the <div> elements with the class 
            "child" are the child elements.
                     <div class="flex-container">
                     <div class="child">Child 1</div>
                     <div class="child">Child 2</div>
                     <div class="child">Child 3</div>
                     </div>
                     Here, "Child 1," "Child 2," and "Child 3" are the child elements of the flex container.

      CSS code:
            CSS code for flex container 
            .flex-container {
               display: flex;
               flex-direction: row; Specifies the main axis as horizontal 
               justify-content: space-between; Aligns child elements with space between them 
               align-items: center; Centers child elements vertically 
            }
            
            CSS code for child elements 
            .child {
               flex-grow: 1; Allows child elements to grow and fill available space 
               flex-basis: 0; Sets the initial size of child elements to 0 
               padding: 10px; Adds padding to child elements 
               background-color: #eaeaea; Sets background color for child elements 
            } */
